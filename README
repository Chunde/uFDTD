2013/10/22 Ran into issues with multirow.sty not being found with the
current distribution of LaTeX.  So, grabbed that off the Web (from
CTAN).  Unpacked the zip file I downloaded which created the directory
multirow.  I created a symbolic link from the root directory to the
multirow.sty in that directory and then everything seemed to compile
okay.

Notes:

* Should improve Fig. 2.1.

* Should perhaps add a label "S" for the surface in Figs. 2.2 and
  2.3.

* Should add figures for boundary conditions.

* Should add a table explaining use of notation

     c = speed of light {\em in free space}
     N_\lambda = point per wavelength
 
  etc.  Would help me be consistent

Done:
- The wave equation should be added to the review chapter (2).
  Additionally the proof that f(t+/-x/c) are solutions to the wave
  equation -- which currently appears as an appendix in chap. 3 --
  should be move to chap. 2.

Done:
- should added something to show Delta_x and Delta_t to Figs. 3.1-3.3.

Done!
- Need better way to include code.  Would like to be able to have some
  text as bold (e.g., when it was just added to code that was
  otherwise unchanged).  Also, floats can be split across multiple
  pages.  Hmmm, something to ponder...

* Chap 3: Probably should add a plot which shows a single snapshot of
  the dielectric case so that the magnitude of the transmitted and
  reflected pulse can be seen.

* I'm not as consistent as I probably should be when it comes to "E_z"
  vs. "the E_z field" (similarly for H_y).  So, I will say things like
  "plots of the $E_z$ field are ..."  Wouldn't be just as clear, and a
  bit more terse/clean, to say simply "plots of $E_z$ are ..."?  I
  think so.

* Don't think I'm consistent in the use of the terms temporal step,
  temporal step size, and time step.  Perhaps temporal step should
  refer to del_t and temporal index should refer to q.  Similarly for
  space: spatial step = del_x and spatial index = m, n, or p.  Thus
  "size" shouldn't appear anywhere in the text.

* Should add a section to the EM review about harmonic fields and
  phasor notation.

* MoM stuff: Should have a discussion of general integral equations.

* MoM stuff: 

  o After getting through the symmetry stuff, should probably have a
  discussion about how the modified basis function is somewhat
  equivalent to a modified Green's function.  Should say that we want
  the Green's function to include as much of the environmental
  information as possible.

  o Then should explore the two-plate problem and show how, assuming
  equal and opposite charge, it is equivalent to charge above an
  infinite ground plane.  The use of an appropriate Green's function
  should be discussed.

  o Would be nice to have some discussion of dielectric materials!!!
  Can see the Ph.D. work and papers of Juha Avelin for pointers into
  the literature.
